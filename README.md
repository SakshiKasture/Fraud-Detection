# Fraud-Detection
 The goal of this project was to detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset from Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset  which has imbalance data.

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, as fraudulent transactions represent only a small fraction of all transactions. 
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, available on Kaggle. It contains anonymized transaction features (due to confidentiality) and a target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (Class = 1) or not (Class = 0).

Download the dataset from Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection

After downloading the dataset (creditcard.csv), place it in the root folder of the project before running the code.
